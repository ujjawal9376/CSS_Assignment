        <p>Initially launched in 2010 as Google Web Fonts, Google Fonts is a collection of interactive application
            programming interfaces that allow users to use web fonts on their website. This service is hosted by Google,
            and all the fonts and bandwidth is free.
        </p>
        <p>Our font catalog places typography front and center, inviting users to explore, sort, and test fonts for
            use in more than 135 languages. We showcase individual type designers and foundries, giving you valuable
            information about the typographers and their process, as well as analytics on usage and demographics. Our
            series of
            thematic collections helps you discover new fonts that have been vetted and organized by our team of
            designers,
            engineers, and collaborators, and our default sort organizes fonts based on popularity, trends, and your
            geographic
            location. You can also create your own highly customized collections by filtering families, weights, and
            scripts, plus test color
            themes, and review sample copy. Collections can be shared, making it easy to collaborate on projects and
            ensure
            typography is optimized and streamlined throughout the design and engineering process. In 2021, we added
            icons to our
            Google Fonts catalog, expanding expressive capability for our users. Our first set was the Material
            iconsâ€”delightful,
            beautifully crafted symbols for common communication needs. Download them on desktop to use them in your
            digital products forAndroid, iOS,and web.
